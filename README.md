- A fully functional and persistent music player. Upon loading, it pulls a predetermined playlist which a user can choose to play. As a user navigates around the website, they also have the ability to play or add songs to a queue. The music player also has built in logic to start and stop at appropriate times, such as stopping when a video is played.
